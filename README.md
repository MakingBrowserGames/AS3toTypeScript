AS3 To TypeScript Convertor
===========================

Version 1.0

April 2nd 2013

By Richard Davey, [Photon Storm](http://www.photonstorm.com)

I build a lot of HTML5 games in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) which includes converting Flash AS3 games. I found that I was going through the same processes over and over again when converting the AS3 source code to TypeScript. Simple things like swapping "Boolean" for "bool" and many other tedious tasks. So I wrote a PHP script that would do it for me and I'm sharing it here with you.

Getting Started Guide
---------------------

Checkout the git repo.

You will need to be running a local httpd server with PHP support. On Windows I recommend [WAMP Server](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) and on OS X [MAMP Pro](http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/).

You'll find an `index.php` file and 2 folders: `input` and `output`.

Copy your ActionScript files to the `input` folder. You can copy across a whole project folder if you like. The script is intelligent enough to deep-scan your folder structure and only pick-up `.as` files.

Load the `index.php` page in a web browser and if all is well it should give you a list of the AS files.

You can now elect to convert either a single file by clicking on it, or batch convert the whole lot.

Your web server will need local write permissions to save the generated TypeScript files.

If the output folder doesn't exist it will be created. If the output folder already exists any files in it will be automatically over-written.

Conversion Tasks
----------------

Currently the following tasks are performed by the script:

* Boolean to bool
* uint to number
* int to number
* Number to number
* remove :void
* rename package to module
* public class to class
* comment out import statements
* 'internal var' to 'private' (as close as TS gets, but often incorrect)
* swap static order
* append class name in front of consts
* 'protected var' to 'private' (as close as TS gets, but often incorrect)
* 'public var' to 'public'
* public function
* private function
* internal function
* override public function
* constructor swap
* remove :Array
* remove :Function

It will also generate a list of class level consts and properties.

It's easy to add extra tests, or re-order the sequence in which they are performed so please feel free to do so if the default set don't quite meet your needs!
